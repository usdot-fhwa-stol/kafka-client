# Kafka Client Library

The CARMA Time Library is a focused library providing classes and utilities which enable a consuming project to synchronize mock time with the CARMA simulation framework.
# Using the Library

The following sections will describe how to use the CARMA Time Library in your C++ or Python application

### Install library

The easiest way to include the CARMA Time Library in your application is to install it via `apt`.
**Prerequisites**

- Ubuntu ( jammy, focal, bionic )
- CMake 3.10
- Python 3

The CARMA Time library is one the the FHWA (Federal Highway Administration) STOL (Saxton Transportation Operation Library) libraries built into a Debian package via CMake/CPack scripts from the [carma-builds](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-builds) repository. CI (Continuous Integration) scripts also push this Debian package to a STOL Debian Package repository. To install this package you must only add this repository to `apt`.

```shell
# Get ubuntu distribution code name. All STOL APT debian packages are pushed to S3 bucket based on distribution codename.
. /etc/lsb-release
# add the STOL APT repository
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://s3.amazonaws.com/stol-apt-repository ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stol-apt-repository.list
apt update
apt install carma-clock-1
```

This steps above add the relavent STOL apt repository for pulling correct debian package.
> [!IMPORTANT]\
>The python bindings for **CARMA Time Lib** are not included by default in the debian package. To install this library for use
with python we suggest you install it locally with the following steps

```shell
./install_dependencies.sh
cmake -Bbuild -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON .
cmake --build build
```

### Including with CMake (C++)
To find and link this library via CMake the following commands are necessary

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10.2)
...
# This can be set inside CMake files or via argument passed to cmake CLI calls
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "/opt/carma/cmake")
...
# Find CMake package
find_package(carma-clock REQUIRED)
...
# Link against library
target_link_libraries( ${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
    ::carma-clock

)
```

### Importing as Python Module
> [!IMPORTANT]\
>Python module support is currently only available for x86/amd devices
To import this library as a python module the following is necessary.

```python
# This path can be added via the sys module or by directly appending the PYTHON_PATH environment variable.
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/library')
# Import C++ library as python module
import importlib
libcarma_clock = importlib.import_module("libcarma-clock")

...
# Initialize CARMA Clock object
clock = libcarma_clock.CarmaClock(False)

```

## Configuration

The following operating modes are available in the library:
* Real-time
* Simulated time

TODO How the library is configured

TODO Move this configuration logic into a time manager tool in a separate library.
# Architecture

The CarmaClock class contains an internal representation for time which serves as a replacement for the epoch tracked by the system clock, or any other related time-keeping machinery.

This internal time value is stored as a TODO value representing TODO since TODO.

The framework provides the following capabilities:
1. Initialization and update functions which set the internal time representation mode and value.
2. Current time available for query.
3. Time representation available in real-time and simulation mode.
4. The framework falls back to system time if not running in simulation mode.
5. Utility functions.

# Building the Library
## Configuring Build Environment

The project build environment is supplied as a single-image [Docker Dev Environment](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dev-environments/), with Visual Studio Code editor configurations to enable streamlined setup.

To load the project in VSCode:

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-time-lib.git
cd carma-time-lib/
```

2. Open the VSCode editor.
3. Open the cloned project folder.
4. Accept the **Reopen in Container** prompt for **"Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container (learn more)."**

![Dev Container Rebuild Notification](doc/images/DevContainerRebuildNotification.png)

7. If that prompt did not appear, open the **View > Command Palette** and type to locate **"Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"**.
6. The editor should refresh and display the updated activity in the command line.

If the container startup was successful, the development environment is up and running and contains the library dependencies and compilation environment. It is possible to proceed with the build.

## Building

1. In VSCode, open **Build the Terminal > Run Build Task...**.

![Library Build Log](doc/images/LibraryBuildLog.png)

2. If the build is successful, tests are automatically executed and a Debian package is generated.
3. TODO more details (output product locations, reference information for generalized docker dev solution including container configured locations etc.).

## Additional IDE Configuration

Some additional configurations are provided out-of-the-box to streamline the developer's setup process. These are included for Visual Studio Code:
